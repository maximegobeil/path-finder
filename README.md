# A* Algorithm Path Finder

This project help to visualize the A* algorithm. We can create walls, change the start or end spot and use diagonal neighbors or not. I used P5.js to create the grid.<br>
Basic neighbors(#):<br> * # *
                    <br># * #
                    <br>* # * <br>
Diagonal neighbors add those one: <br># * #
                                  <br>* * *
                                  <br># * # <br>

Use: You can simply start creating walls by clicking on the grid. If you want to enable the delete walls mode, you'll see this option in the left part with all others control.
